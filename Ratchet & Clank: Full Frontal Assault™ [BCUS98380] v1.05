# The 1st set of lines runs constantly while in a level, and will make the gold bolts on that level vanish. It only does the level you are currently on, so you will need to have this on at some point on each level.
# The 2nd set activates any time you access Hero Profile and gives you all of them for all levels.
# Use both to make things look normal or you will end up picking up more gold bolts than the game actually has.

    Notes: Think of how the Warmonger or Cryoshot require you to repeatedly press fire instead of just holding it to fire. All weapons will have that behavior but can fire as fast as you can press it.
