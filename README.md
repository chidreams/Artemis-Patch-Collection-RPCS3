# Aldo's PS3 Cheat Database to RPCS3 Patching System

## Introduction

This project is dedicated to porting Aldo's extensive PS3 cheat database to the RPCS3 patching system. Our goal is to make these cheats more accessible and easy to use within the RPCS3 emulator.

## Features

- Supports approximately 2900 games.
- Easy to use: simply select the game and apply the cheat.
- Regular updates: we aim to keep the cheat database up-to-date with new games and cheats.

## How it Works

The RPCS3 patching system allows for game modifications through the use of patch files. We have taken Aldo's PS3 cheat database and converted these cheats into a format that can be recognized and used by the RPCS3 emulator.

## Usage

1. Download the cheat database from this repository.
2. Place the downloaded file in the RPCS3 patch directory.
3. Launch RPCS3 and navigate to the game you wish to apply cheats to.
4. Apply the cheats from the cheat database.
